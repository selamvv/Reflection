            <h1>Fully Comprehend: CSS Selectors </h1>
            <p>
            There are many different types of css selector but with an understanding of the main ones, the rest won't be difficult to apply. The main ones I am going to explain to use are type, id and class.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>type</li>
                <p>Type selectors are used with any HTML elements including h1, p, body, div, etc. The syntax to select type selectors is to simply type out the element and follow it by brackets with the style description. Type selectors select every element type with the element name provided the description will apply to every element of the same type </p>
                <li>id</li>
                <p>Id lables are given to specific elements, no two elements can have the same id, this is helpful when you want for an example a div element to have a different background color then all of the other div elements. If you had wanted all of the div elements to have the same background color, you  go back to the type element above. The way one would select an id selector to work with it is by adding a # in front of the selector with the given id.</p>
                <li>class</li>
                <p>However, say that you want something in between, you don't want to select all of one element but you dont want only one, maybe you want two out of four of an element type on your page to have the same background. This is when you can use a class selector. Unlike an id selector, a class can be given to as many elements as one wants. The way one would select a class is with a period in front of the class name. </p>
                </ul>

            <h1>Need Futher Explanation for: Web Scrapping</h1>
                <p>A component that I still don't have an understanding of in this course is what web scraping is, when and why one would apply it. I am aware that it is a method to collect html data. I know the components needed for it are the url of a website, a function and a file name. I also don't understand why it cannot be done in a browser. I am also confused as to what jquery does and what the dollar signs are for in the code.</p>
